    "text": "To get familiar with ArcGIS Pro, you will complete an Introduction to ArcGIS Pro tutorial and watch a four other short videos. The tutorial will take about 25 minutes and give you a brief overview of the ArcGIS Pro. The videos illustrate other important aspects of the ArcGIS Pro software package and will take about 10-15 minutes to watch.\n\n\nIf you have purchased ArcGIS Pro, you can sign in through the UBC ArcGIS online account you created. If you are using the lab computers, and don’t already have one, create a public account:\n\nClick “Sign In” in the top right of this page\nClick “Create a public account” and follow the steps\n\nGo to the Introducing ArcGISPro tutorial. Watch the short introductory video, then work through the steps. You will be submitting a map from this tutorial for credit.\n\nYou already have a project open, so you can start with Open the project step 2 Note.\nNote, if you have trouble in “Opening the project, Step 3” for either tutorial, you can download the data for off line use instead\nWhen you get to “Explore Views, Step 7”, double click on the map title and add your name following the video below.\n\nVideo\n\n\nSave the layout as a .pdf, name it Central_Wellington_Layout.pdf. You will upload this map to canvas. To save your layout reference the image below.\n\nClick Share.\nClick Layout Export.\nSpecify the output location and name your file. Its best to use your Lab1_Project workspace so you can easily find this when its time to submit you map.\nClick Export.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESRI offers quite a few tutorials on ArcGIS Pro. Feel free to work though them if you have time! But we’re just going to watch the overview videos from four tutorials to learn a bit more about what we can do with ArcGIS Pro. I’ve hyperlinked to each tutoral page for your reference and embeded the relevant video below each video link.\n\n\nThis tutorial shows you how you can interact with and explore data layers. You can find the tutorial instructions here or watch the video below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial shows you how you can use map layouts to visualize data.

    "text": "Setting up a Project\nWhen ArcPro opens choose the Map under Blank Templates as shown below then create your new project. I’ve named mine Lab1_Project so I can easily identify it. This will be the name of the folder your project is saved in. Set the location to an appropriate workspace.\n\nI am working on my own computer, and my workspace workspace is “C:\\2021_S1”. This is the location where the project folder will be reside. If you are working on a lab computer, you should put your project in C:.\nIt is very important to familiarize yourself with the procedures for saving your work if you are working on a lab computer.\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Windows operating system (OS), it might be helpful to take a few moments to learn about the differences between Windows and the OS (Mac, Linux) you are used to working with. Once you set up a new project, close ArcGIS Pro for now.\n\n\n\nGeodatabases\nBy default, ArcPro creates a geodatabase with every new project. You will see one called Lab1_Project.gdb in your project folder. See the definitions below for important info about geodatabases.\nGeodatabase: A file management structure that is unique to ESRI products. You don’t have to store your data in a geodatabase (.gdb), but they have some enhanced functionality that makes them better than regular folders in some circumstances. One helpful thing we can do in a .gdb, is create a feature dataset to store our census data.\nFeature Dataset: A collections of feature classes that are all in the same coordinate system. When you add a data to a feature dataset, it will automatically be projected into the coordinate system we specify. This can help us avoid making mistakes like working with data that is in the wrong coordinate system!\nFeature Class: A vector data layer stored in a geodatabase. Its a special file type created by ESRI to store data effectively within ArcGIS Pro. When vector data layers are not stored in a geodatabase, they are stored in other formats, such as shapefiles or geojsons.\n\n\nDownload Data\nLets download the data we need and put it in the Lab1_Project folder you just created. Click the download link. If a pop up appears, choose save, the file will be saved in the downloads folder.\n\n\nExtract the Data\nOpen the windows file explorer (folder on bottom ribbon or search the start menu). Navigate to the downloads folder. You will see a folder called “CholeraOutbreak_1854.gdb”, note the type “Compressed (zipped) Folder” and size 11709 KB. Right click on the CholeraOutbreak_1854.gdb, choose a zip file manager, and select “Extract files”.\n\nZip files (.zip) are a method for compressing data so it can be stored and transfered more efficiently. However, to work with the data, we have to extract it.\nOn my computer, the 7-Zip is the .zip file manager. If you are working on the geography department computers, you can uses PeaZip instead. The specific options might differ, but the general principal is the same.\n\n\n\n\nSave it to your Project Folder!\nIn the pop up window, set your Lab1_Project folder as the Extract to location.\n\nThe lab data is now downloaded and stored in your project folder."

    "text": "Working with Historical Data\nWe are going to be working with the hand drawn cholera map created by Dr. Snow showing cholera cases in SoHo. I’ve gone thought most of the steps of extracting the data for you already. This section walks you through the process of how it is typically done.\n\nGeoreferencing\nIn order to get a historical map into a GIS, it has to be scanned and then georeferenced. To georeference a map like, locations on the scanned image (eg. intersections) can be matched up to known reference points.\n\nWith enough matching points (>=3), an accurate transformation can be calculated and the paper map can be referenced to the proper location. I’ve done this for you to save some time.\nWatch the video linked below for a quick overview of georeferencing.\n\n\n\nOnce a map has been georeferenced, we can extract information from it. On Dr. Snow’s map, the key pieces of information are the cholera deaths and water pumps. To get this information into the GIS, the points have to be manually identified and entered. This process is known as digitizing, and was explained in the Create points on a map video. We’ll get some practice digitizing in a bit."

To view other folders, you have to add folder connections. We’ll cover this later in the semester.\n\n\nFind the Deaths feature class, which is located in the SourcePoints Feature Dataset in the CholeraOutbreak_1854.gdb. Click and drag the deaths feature class onto the map area.\nRight click again and open the attribute table to explore the data a bit.\n\n\nYou can double click count to sort in ascending/descending order.\nClick a row to select a specific feature (eg. identify location with most deaths).\n\nVideo\n\nInspect the Data\nRight click “COUNT” in the attribute table and choose “Statistics” as shown below.

Follow the steps as outlined and refer to the video below.\n\nRight click on SourcePoints in the catalog pane and click New > Feature Class.\nIn the new window that opens, give the new feature a name and alias, set the type to point, and click Next.\n\n\nArc Pro does not allow Feature Classes to have certain characters (eg. spaces) in file names. But you can set the alias to display spaces\nFeature classes can take multiple different types. The three most common, which we will mainly be concerned with are: Points, Lines, and Polygons\n\nWe’ll discuss the differences in detail in lecture\n\n\n\nAdd a new field called Name with type text then click Next.\n\n\nFields allow us to store information about the features in a table. In this case, the only information we want to store is the name. We will encounter circumstances later where we store many attributes for each feature.\n\n\nNote the Spatial Reference System then click Finish.\n\n\nFeature Datasets require that all feature classes within them have the same Spatial Reference System, so the projection is automatically set to that of the SourcePoints feature dataset (WGS 1984 Web Mercator)\n\nIf you aren’t working in a preexisting feature dataset, this would be your chance to specify it\n\nWe don’t need to concern ourselves with the options on the next three pages for now.\n\nVideo\n\nDigitizing a Point\nNow we are going to digitize the location of the Broad St. Pump. Follow the steps as outlined and refer to the video below.\n\nFind the Snow_cholera_map in the CholeraOutbreak_1854.gdb, click and drag it onto the map.\nOpen the Edit tab and click Create, in the create pane that appears, click Broad St. Pump and choose point from the options that appear.\n\n\nThe edit tab allows us to create, modify, save, and delete data among other things\nCreate is used specifically to add new features to an existing feature data set.\n\nRight now we’re creating a single point feature. We’ll learn how to digitize lines and polygons later on in the semester.\n\n\n\nClick on the location of the Broad St. pump as shown on Dr. Snow’s original map, then save your edits.\n\n\nZoom into the Broad St. area on the map, click on the location of the pump to add a point feature.\n\nIf you make a mistake, you can hit ctrl + z to undo your additions\nNote Snapping is sometimes set to on by default. It will cause the cursor to jump to the nearest feature in another layer (eg. Deaths). It is useful in some situations, but not here. It can be turned off by clicking snapping in the Edit tab.\n\nSave your edits after every change to make them permanent.\n\n\nOpen the attribute table and name the newly created feature “Broad St. Pump”\n\n\nYou can type directly into the attribute table to edit the newly created features Name value, which is blank for now.\nClicking a new row in the attribute table will add and “empty” feature with no spatial component.\n\nYou can right click on a row to delete that feature\n\nSave your edits to make them permanent.\n\nVideo\n\n\nSave your project.\nClick Save in the top left of the Arc Pro window.

    "section": "Spatial Analysis",
    "text": "Spatial Analysis\nWe already know the Broad St. pump was the source of the outbreak, but lets explore a couple analysis techniques we could use to identify the source of an outbreak.\n\nMeasures of Central Tendency\nThere are numerous ways to analyze the spatial distribution of a dataset. The Mean Center and Directional Distribution are two of the simplest measures. Mean center gives you a single point around which the directional distribution creates an ellipse to show directional trends in the data. Don’t calculate these statistics, just skim the linked pages and look at the example below to understand what these methods do.\n\nThey can be weighted (eg. by the number of deaths per address).\nThese measures roughly identify the Broad St. Pump as the source of the outbreak, as shown in the figure below.\n\nHowever, they are rudimentary metrics at best. They could be used to identify multiple point sources for example.\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel Density\nA more advanced method is Kernel Density, which gives you a magnitude (eg. number of deaths) per unit area (eg. hectare). Follow the steps as outlined and refer to the video below to calculate the Kernel Density of cholera deaths in Soho.\n\nClick the Analysis tab and select Tools. In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and open the Kernel Density tool.\n\n\nThe Geoprocessing pane is where you can find all the different spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS Pro.\n\n\nSet Deaths as the input and COUNT as the Population Field.\n\n\nThe population field weights the calculations by the number of deaths at each address.\n\n\nRerun the analysis multiple times, playing around with different Output cell sizes and Area units. When you are done exploring the effects of cell size and units, calculate the Kernel Density with a cell size of 5 and unit of Hectares.\n\n\nA Hectare is 10,000 m2, or about the area a small city block.\n\nVideo\n\n\nSave your project.\nClick Save in the top left of the Arc Pro window."

Reorder the legend items if desired. * Legends items have many different settings we can fine tune. For now, we’ll just change a few. * You can add/remove & reorder legend items using the check box on the right. * Changing the number of classes in the Kernel Density layer makes it fit better. * Slowly double clicking on an item in the table of contents on the left allows you to edit the text. You can change layer names so they make more sense.\n\n\nTitle\nAdd a a title using the Straight Text (see video). Give your map an appropriate title and font size.\n\nTitles should be concise and descriptive.\nThey should be the largest font element on the map\n\n\n\nSource Statement\nUse the same procedure to add a data source, creator name, and date to the map.\n\nIt is important to credit data sources.\nList yourself as the creator.\nAdd a date so the reader knows when the map was created.\nThe credit text can be smaller and “tucked away” at the bottom of the map.\n\n\n\nScale Bar and North Arrow\nAdd a north arrow & scale bar\n\nMake sure your units are in metric!\n\nVideo"

These folders are all part of your user profile which travels to/from the server when you log in/off. The more data there is in the profile the longer it will take to log in/off.
