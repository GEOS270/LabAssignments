You may purchase a student version of the software to install on your own computer for $20. ArcGIS Pro only runs on the **Windows** OS.

# Option 2: Geography Lab Computers

The Geography Department has two computer labs (rooms 115 and 237).  They may be accessed in-person when the geography building is open or they can be accessed via remote desktop connection 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  All students will be given a UBC Geography logon, you should receive logon credentials by email before the first day of lab.

## Lab fee

There is a lab fee to use geography computers.  You must [pay the lab fee](https://geog-epayment.sites.olt.ubc.ca/fees/geoglab-fees/) or you will loose access to your account.  The lab fee is due by {{< var Lab.fee_due >}}


* If you have not received logon credentials, contact {{< var Lab.LabHelp.name >}} at: {{< var Lab.LabHelp.email >}}


## Remote Access

To remotely access lab computers, follow [these instructions](RemoteDesktop.pdf).  Information about the Geography Computer Labs can be found [here](https://geog.ubc.ca/undergraduate/study-resources/).  

* **Note** the lab schedule and refrain from remotely accessing a computer while other courses are holding lab session in that room.  When accessing computers remotely - try to use computers that are located in room 239 as those are less likely to result in conflicts with in-person users.

* **If you are having trouble logging on remotely** try: adding "geoglab\" in front of your username.
