# Part 1:  Map Projections Tutorial

This map [projection tutorial](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/map-projections/content/exercises.html) was created by Maya Daurio at the UBC Research Commons.  The tutorial has four exercises.  Download the data on the exercise page then work through each exercise to get a quick overview of how to work with coordinate systems in ArcGIS Pro.

## Exercise 1 What Coordinate System is my Data in?

- Learn how to determine the coordinate system of a layer

## Exercise 2 Projecting On-the-Fly

- Learn how ArcGIS Pro handles layers with different coordinate systems

## Exercise 3 Project Your Data

- Change the coordinate system of your layer

## Exercise 4 Calculating Population Density

- See the material impact of different projections
- Learn how to use Feature Datasets to manage projections
- Create a field and calculate population density


# Part 2: Comparing Coordinate Systems

## Four Ways to Display Canada

Create a figure showing Canada displayed using four different coordinate systems.  Your submission should look something like the figure below, you can reference the video for help setting things up.

The key components you need for full credit are:

* Four maps on one sheet showing Canada displayed using the following coordinate systems:
	* WGS 1984
	* Web Mercator
	* Canada Lambert Conformal Conic
	* Canada Albers Equal Area
* Your name & date created
* Map scale shown in **two** ways on each map
	* Scale text
	* Scale bar
* A graticule showing lines of Latitude and Longitude
	* Use the same spacing (15 degrees) for each map
