It is broken into two parts.  \n\n**First** you will work through some tutorial materials put together by ESRI to gain some familiarity with using ArcGIS Pro.  \n\n* You will complete the ArcGIS Pro Tutorial to make your first map!  \n* Then watch a few videos to gain familiarity with some other aspects of the application.\n\n**Then** you will recreate an example from history using modern geospatial analysis methods.  Dr. John Snow was the first person to prove that Cholera was a waterborne pathogen.  He used manual surveying, a paper map, and rudimentary geospatial analysis to identify a well as the source of a Cholera out break in London.\n\n* You will apply a modern method known as [kernel density](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/kernel-density.htm) to recreate this analysis and see if you can find the well that caused the outbreak.\n\n## Warning\n\n{{< var Lab.assignments.saving >}}\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"objectives.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","_quarto-vars":{"course":{"term":"2023 S1","code":"GEOS 270"},"instructor":{"name":"Dr. June skeeter","pronouns":"They/Them/Theirs","email":"june.skeeter@ubc.ca","office":"Room 144, Geography Bldg Office hours after lecture","zoom_office":"By Appointment **with at least 24 hr notice** [Office Hours Link](https://ubc.zoom.us/j/66359522453?pwd=ZzZUMzV3NVY1V3pzcmYzZFBadW93UT09)","photo":"June.jpg","about":"My name is June.  I am a non-binary geographer, researcher, and educator who has been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015.  I have been teaching GEOS 270 since 2020.  I am passionate about teaching Geographic Information Science and using Geographic Information Systems as a tool to address social and ecological justice issues.  My principal aim this semester is to provide a holistic introduction to the study of Geographic Information Science and application of Geographic Information Systems.  I use GIS extensively is my research on climate change in the wetland ecosystems working as a Postdoc for the UBC Micrometeorology Lab.  We study carbon balances in wetland ecosystems in the Metro Vancouver area."},"keyInfo":{"lecture_time":"Tuesday & Thursday, 12:00 - 14:00","lecture_room":101,"zoom":"https://ubc.zoom.us/j/68315782631?pwd=RFh0QmR1SzJ3cjhwYmlYSkZNbkcydz09","recordings":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bFWXslXnAQC5SIYX6z3dLyhtGzwQ3k98?usp=sharing","tophat_code":495132,"piazza_link":"https://piazza.com/ubc.ca/summer2023/geos270"},"exam":{"type":"asynchronous over Canvas"},"Lab":{"grace_period":4,"zoom":"https://ubc.zoom.us/j/63605592624?pwd=dEd6TExsd29RQmc2dzJ6NGVZTDN2UT09","fee_due":"Friday June 2nd","TA1":{"name":"Zijie Chai","pronouns":"She/Her/Hers","email":"zijie01@mail.ubc.ca","office":"Room 225, Geography Bldg.","photo":"Zijie.jpg","about":"My name is Zijie and I am a MSc student in Geography, studying the Contributions of glaciers to streamflow and how they have varied in response to climatic variability and glacier changes in Columbia River Basin.
