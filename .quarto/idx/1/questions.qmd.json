I am a non-binary geographer, researcher, and educator who has been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015.  I have been teaching GEOS 270 since 2020.  I am passionate about teaching Geographic Information Science and using Geographic Information Systems as a tool to address social and ecological justice issues.  My principal aim this semester is to provide a holistic introduction to the study of Geographic Information Science and application of Geographic Information Systems.  I use GIS extensively is my research on climate change in the wetland ecosystems working as a Postdoc for the UBC Micrometeorology Lab.  We study carbon balances in wetland ecosystems in the Metro Vancouver area."},"keyInfo":{"lecture_time":"Tuesday & Thursday, 12:00 - 14:00","lecture_room":101,"zoom":"https://ubc.zoom.us/j/68315782631?pwd=RFh0QmR1SzJ3cjhwYmlYSkZNbkcydz09","recordings":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bFWXslXnAQC5SIYX6z3dLyhtGzwQ3k98?usp=sharing","tophat_code":495132,"piazza_link":"https://piazza.com/ubc.ca/summer2023/geos270"},"exam":{"type":"asynchronous over Canvas"},"Lab":{"grace_period":4,"zoom":"https://ubc.zoom.us/j/63605592624?pwd=dEd6TExsd29RQmc2dzJ6NGVZTDN2UT09","fee_due":"Friday June 2nd","TA1":{"name":"Zijie Chai","pronouns":"She/Her/Hers","email":"zijie01@mail.ubc.ca","office":"Room 225, Geography Bldg.","photo":"Zijie.jpg","about":"My name is Zijie and I am a MSc student in Geography, studying the Contributions of glaciers to streamflow and how they have varied in response to climatic variability and glacier changes in Columbia River Basin.
