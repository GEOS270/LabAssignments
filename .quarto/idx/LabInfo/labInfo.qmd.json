They focus on GIS applications, giving you a chance to get hands on practice working with GIS software (ArcGIS Pro).  Most labs have associated videos and/or readings.  There is no textbook for the course, pdf files will be provided where applicable.  You can work through the labs in your lab section but they may also require some extra time outside of scheduled lab hours.\n\n* Labs will be formatted as open help sessions.  They are your chance to get one-on-one help from your TA and you may also use them to work collaboratively with your classmates.\n  * Lab attendance is not mandatory, but it is strongly encouraged.\n* There is course [piazza]({{< var keyInfo.piazza_link >}}) page which you can use post/answer questions about the lab materials.\n\n```{r include=FALSE}\n\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n\n\n```{r}\n#| tbl-cap: \"Lab Sections\"\n#| tbl-colwidths: [20,40,40]\n\nChecklist <- read.csv(file = '../sheets/LabTimes.csv',sep='|')\nkable(Checklist)\n\n```\n\n# Your TAs\n\n---\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n:::{.column width=\"30%\"}\n\n![](images/{{< var Lab.TA1.photo >}}){width=85%}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n |\n-----|:-----\nName|{{< var Lab.TA1.name >}}\nPronouns|{{< var Lab.TA1.pronouns >}}\nEmail|{{< var Lab.TA1.email >}}\nOffice|{{< var Lab.TA1.office >}}\n\n\n::: \n\n::::\n\n{{< var Lab.TA1.about >}}\n\n---\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n:::{.column width=\"30%\"}\n\n![](images/{{< var Lab.TA2.photo >}}){width=85%}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n\n |\n-----|:-----\nName|{{< var Lab.TA2.name >}}\nPronouns|{{< var Lab.TA2.pronouns >}}\nEmail|{{< var Lab.TA2.email >}}\nOffice|{{< var Lab.TA2.office >}}\n\n::: \n\n::::\n\n{{< var Lab.TA2.about >}}\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"labInfo.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","_quarto-vars":{"course":{"term":"2023 S1","code":"GEOS 270"},"instructor":{"name":"Dr. June skeeter","pronouns":"They/Them/Theirs","email":"june.skeeter@ubc.ca","office":"Room 144, Geography Bldg Office hours after lecture","zoom_office":"By Appointment **with at least 24 hr notice** [Office Hours Link](https://ubc.zoom.us/j/66359522453?pwd=ZzZUMzV3NVY1V3pzcmYzZFBadW93UT09)","photo":"June.jpg","about":"My name is June.  I am a non-binary geographer, researcher, and educator who has been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015.  I have been teaching GEOS 270 since 2020.  I am passionate about teaching Geographic Information Science and using Geographic Information Systems as a tool to address social and ecological justice issues.  My principal aim this semester is to provide a holistic introduction to the study of Geographic Information Science and application of Geographic Information Systems.  I use GIS extensively is my research on climate change in the wetland ecosystems working as a Postdoc for the UBC Micrometeorology Lab.
