  about: My name is June.  I am a non-binary geographer, researcher, and educator who has been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015.  I have been teaching GEOS 270 since 2020.  I am passionate about teaching Geographic Information Science and using Geographic Information Systems as a tool to address social and ecological justice issues.  My principal aim this semester is to provide a holistic introduction to the study of Geographic Information Science and application of Geographic Information Systems.  I use GIS extensively is my research on climate change in the wetland ecosystems working as a Postdoc for the UBC Micrometeorology Lab.  We study carbon balances in wetland ecosystems in the Metro Vancouver area.
